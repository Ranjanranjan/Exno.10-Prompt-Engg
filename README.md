# Aim: 
To perform Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

# Objective:
The goal of this experiment is to demonstrate how different AI prompting techniques can significantly impact the quality, coherence, structure, and creativity of content generated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT (GPT-4.5 Turbo). This is especially relevant in generating structured outputs such as reports, articles, case studies, and even creative works like comic scripts.
The experiment showcases how deliberate design of prompt structures, using patterns such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, and more, results in varied and optimized content outputs.


# Algorithm:
The algorithm used in this experiment outlines a structured approach to crafting prompts and analyzing the generated outputs.
Define the Content Type: Decide the format of content to be generated, such as a report, article, case study, or comic.
Select a Prompt Technique: Choose one of the following advanced prompting strategies:
Query Decomposition
Decision-Making Prompting
Semantic Filtering
Role-Based Prompting
Chain-of-Thought Prompting
Few-Shot Prompting

### Craft the Prompt: 
Design the input prompt by applying the chosen strategy. Ensure the instruction is clear, specific, and context-rich.
### Feed the Prompt to ChatGPT (GPT-4.5 Turbo): 
Use OpenAI ChatGPT to generate the content by submitting the designed prompt.
### Analyze the Output: 
Evaluate the response for quality, relevance, creativity, structure, and how well it fulfills the prompt's objective.
### Document the Results: 
Record the technique used, the prompt issued, the generated content, and an analysis of the result.

# In-Algorithm Explanation and Examples:
## Example 1: Structured Report Using Query Decomposition
### Prompt: 
"Generate a detailed report on the environmental impact of plastic waste. Divide it into the following sections: (1) Overview, (2) Data on Production and Waste, (3) Policy Recommendations."
### ChatGPT Output Excerpt:

Overview: Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the world’s ability to deal with them.
Data on Production and Waste: Global plastic production reached 390.7 million tonnes in 2021. Less than 10% of this is recycled.
Policy Recommendations: Governments should enforce bans on single-use plastics, promote biodegradable alternatives, and invest in waste management infrastructure.
### Analysis:
Structure: Clearly follows decomposed prompt.
Quality: Informative and concise.
Coherence: Maintains logical flow.

## Example 2: Article Using Semantic Filtering + Role Prompting
### Prompt: 
"You are a science journalist writing for National Geographic. Write an 800-word article explaining how bees use the sun to navigate. Use accessible language."
### ChatGPT Output Excerpt:

"On a bright morning, a honeybee leaves the hive, navigating the open world with a secret only nature could teach. Bees use the sun as a compass, even on cloudy days. Their eyes
can detect polarized light patterns in the sky, allowing them to estimate the sun's location. This enables precise flight paths between flowers and hive."
### Analysis:
Structure: Engaging intro, explanation, application.
Tone: Friendly and educational.
Style: Perfect for general readers.

## Example 3: Case Study Using Chain-of-Thought Prompting
### Prompt: 
"Write a case study about a startup that reduced customer churn using AI. First state the problem, then describe the AI solution, followed by steps of implementation and results."
### ChatGPT Output Excerpt:
#### Problem: 
The company faced a 35% churn rate due to lack of personalized engagement.
#### AI Solution: 
They implemented a machine learning model to predict at-risk customers based on behavior patterns.
#### Implementation: 
Phase 1 involved historical data analysis. Phase 2 deployed targeted campaigns.
#### Results: 
Churn reduced to 18% in three months, increasing customer retention significantly.
###Analysis:
#### Structure: 
Well-ordered logical narrative.
#### Relevance: 
Addresses real-world application.
#### Impact: 
Strong use of metrics.

## Example 4: Comic Script Using Decision-Making Prompting
### Prompt: 
"Create a 5-panel comic script about a teenager facing a moral dilemma: cheat and top the test or be honest and fail. Highlight their thought process and final decision."
### ChatGPT Output Excerpt:

#### Panel 1: 
Teen sits at desk, looking at cheat sheet. *Thought bubble: "Everyone does it... should I?"
#### Panel 2: 
Flashback to teacher saying, "Integrity matters more than grades."
#### Panel 3: 
Looks at friend who is secretly cheating.
#### Panel 4: 
Crumples cheat sheet. *Thought: "No. I want to be proud of this."
#### Panel 5: 
Turns in test with a smile, teacher nods subtly. Analysis:
#### Emotion: 
Strong internal conflict.
### Story Arc: 
Clear beginning, middle, resolution.
### Clarity: 
Script is visual and engaging.



# Result:
The experiment successfully demonstrated how different prompting techniques affect AI- generated video content. Simple to complex prompts, along with style and motion-specific variations, produced a wide range of visual outputs. This confirmed the significance of prompt precision and structure in generating desired video results.
